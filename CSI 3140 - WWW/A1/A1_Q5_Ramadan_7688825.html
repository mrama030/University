Question 5
Create an HTML5 document that contains an autocomplete search form using a search input element in which the user can enter a search query. Add a submit button and a reset button.
Using Google Chrome, test the form by entering January and submitting the form. Then enter J in the input element to see previous entries that started with
J – January should be displayed below the input element. Enter June and submit the form again. Now enter J in the input element to see previous entries that
started with J – January and June should be displayed below the input element. Try this with your own search queries as well. [10 marks] -->
